The projects was developed using Java and contained features such as web crawling, data validation using regular expressions, HTML parsing, inverted indexing, frequency count, page ranking, spell checking, word completion, search frequency, and finding patterns using regular expressions. All the mentioned features were applied to crawl skyscanner.ca - A flight booking website to get the best deals for the entered destination and date of travel.
